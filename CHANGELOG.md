## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2021-09-22
### Added
- Support for specifying exploding notes based on package versions. @cheerfulstoic

## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-20
### Changed
- Lower required version of Elixir from 1.12 to 1.7.  Didn't choose that version for any specific reason and it could perhaps go lower. @cheerfulstoic

## [0.2.0] - 2021-09-20
### Added
- Support plain notes without expressions.  Without this either you keep the built-in TODO/FIXME checks and get duplicates or you disable them and you lose basic notes. @cheerfulstoic

## [0.1.0] - 2021-09-19
### Added
- Basic functionality!  Exploding comments for date/times.  README! @cheerfulstoic
